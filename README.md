# Arduino (internal) EEPROM Data Storage Tutorial

- This GitHub repository provides a comprehensive guide on how to read and write various data types, including bytes, floats, doubles, character strings, and even structs to the EEPROM of your Arduino board.

 - Here we are dealing with data storage to the **internal EEPROM** of Arduino

## Introduction
This repository aims to simplify the process of working with EEPROM on your Arduino board. It covers the basics of reading and writing data types like bytes, floats, doubles, character strings, and even structs into EEPROM memory. By following the examples and guidelines provided here, you'll be able to integrate EEPROM storage seamlessly into your Arduino projects.

## Getting Started
Before diving into EEPROM data storage, make sure you have the necessary hardware and development environment set up. You'll need:

 - An Arduino board (UNO/Mega/Lillypad etc ).
 - The Arduino IDE installed on your computer.
 - Basic knowledge of Arduino programming.
